# Tektronix TVS645 Waveform Analyzer Vee

## Description

These VEEs were created with VEE Student 9.3, and used to control the Tektronix TVS645 Waveform Analyzer. It is about 75% feature complete, but it works well enough to use. 

The remaining features are not necessary for operation, and there are still some bugs in the control software due to the text-processing nature of the beast.
